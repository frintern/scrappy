# scrappy

Hi there üëã,

And welcome here ‚ò∫Ô∏è, I am Scrappy the bot, a text analysis and link scraping bot.

I work with feed-like chat interfaces (like Slack) to analyze and scrape links shared to store the links in JSON so they can be accessed via APIs and used in RSS feeds or other information disseminating platforms.

I am currently being built and you can subscribe for notifications to know when I am fully built by selecting to `watch` this repo at the top right corner.
